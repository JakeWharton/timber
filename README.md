![Timber](logo.png)

This is a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal
`Log` class.

I copy this class into all the little apps I make. I'm tired of doing it. Now it's a library.

Behavior is added through `Tree` instances. You can install an instance by calling `Timber.plant`.
Installation of `Tree`s should be done as early as possible. The `onCreate` of your application is
the most logical choice.

The `DebugTree` implementation will automatically figure out from which class it's being called and
use that class name as its tag. Since the tags vary, it works really well when coupled with a log
reader like [Pidcat][1].

There are no `Tree` implementations installed by default because every time you log in production, a
puppy dies.


Usage
-----

Two easy steps:

 1. Install any `Tree` instances you want in the `onCreate` of your application class.
 2. Call `Timber`'s static methods everywhere throughout your app.

Check out the sample app in `timber-sample/` to see it in action.


Lint
----

Timber ships with embedded lint rules to detect problems in your app.

 *  **TimberArgCount** (Error) - Detects an incorrect number of arguments passed to a `Timber` call for
    the specified format string.

        Example.java:35: Error: Wrong argument count, format string Hello %s %s! requires 2 but format call supplies 1 [TimberArgCount]
            Timber.d("Hello %s %s!", firstName);
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 *  **TimberArgTypes** (Error) - Detects arguments which are of the wrong type for the specified format string.

        Example.java:35: Error: Wrong argument type for formatting argument '#0' in success = %b: conversion is 'b', received String (argument #2 in method call) [TimberArgTypes]
            Timber.d("success = %b", taskName);
                                     ~~~~~~~~
 *  **TimberTagLength** (Error) - Detects the use of tags which are longer than Android's maximum length of 23.

        Example.java:35: Error: The logging tag can be at most 23 characters, was 35 (TagNameThatIsReallyReallyReallyLong) [TimberTagLength]
            Timber.tag("TagNameThatIsReallyReallyReallyLong").d("Hello %s %s!", firstName, lastName);
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 *  **LogNotTimber** (Warning) - Detects usages of Android's `Log` that should be using `Timber`.

        Example.java:35: Warning: Using 'Log' instead of 'Timber' [LogNotTimber]
            Log.d("Greeting", "Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName + "!");
                ~

 *  **StringFormatInTimber** (Warning) - Detects `String.format` used inside of a `Timber` call. Timber
    handles string formatting automatically.

        Example.java:35: Warning: Using 'String#format' inside of 'Timber' [StringFormatInTimber]
            Timber.d(String.format("Hello, %s %s", firstName, lastName));
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 *  **BinaryOperationInTimber** (Warning) - Detects string concatenation inside of a `Timber` call. Timber
    handles string formatting automatically and should be preferred over manual concatenation.

        Example.java:35: Warning: Replace String concatenation with Timber's string formatting [BinaryOperationInTimber]
            Timber.d("Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName + "!");
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 *  **TimberExceptionLogging** (Warning) - Detects the use of null or empty messages, or using the exception message
    when logging an exception.

        Example.java:35: Warning: Explicitly logging exception message is redundant [TimberExceptionLogging]
             Timber.d(e, e.getMessage());
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
